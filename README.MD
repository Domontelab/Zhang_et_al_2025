# Zhang\_et\_al\_2025

**Code & analysis notebooks for Zhang *****et al.*****, 2025**

---

## Overview

This repository contains all of the analysis pipelines used in the Zhang *et al.* 2025 study investigating how internal state (hunger, satiation, threat, safety) shapes population‑level neural dynamics in prelimbic cortex and behavior in rats.
The code is organised as a set of Jupyter notebooks that:

* quantify cue‑evoked responses across states
* train **CEBRA** behaviour‑based embeddings
* perform spectral clustering analyses
* generate figure panel included in the paper.

All workflows run in pure Python.
